How Does It Work?

When you create an istringstream object and pass a string to it, you can use the extraction operator (>>) to read words separated by whitespace. Each call to iss >> word extracts the next word from the stream until there are no more words left.
// Time: O(N)
// Space: O(N)

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to sort the sentence based on the trailing numbers
    string sortSentence(string s) {
        istringstream iss(s); // Create a string stream from the input string
        string word, ans;     // Variables to hold each word and the final answer
        vector<string> v(9);  // Vector to store words based on their position (1-9)

        // Read each word from the string stream
        while (iss >> word) {
            // Place the word in the correct position in the vector
            // The position is determined by the last character of the word
            v[word.back() - '1'] = word.substr(0, word.size() - 1);
        }

        // Construct the final sorted sentence
        for (int i = 0; i < 9 && v[i].size(); ++i) {
            if (i > 0) ans += " "; // Add a space before the next word if it's not the first
            ans += v[i];           // Append the word to the answer
        }
        return ans; // Return the sorted sentence
    }
};
